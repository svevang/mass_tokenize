# MassTokenize

MassTokenize takes large filesystem trees of English text and turns them
into a list of tokenized English words.

Built to operate on
[wikiextractor](https://github.com/attardi/wikiextractor) output,
MassTokenize accepts flags to parse the line-oriented JSON emitted by
wikiextractor (see `--json-lines`) or operates on the entire file.
